    <h3>Family and Early Life</h3>
    <p>
        Justin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee,
        to Lynn (Bomar) Harless and Charles Randall Timberlake, a Baptist church choir director.
        Timberlake grew up in Shelby Forest, a small community between Memphis and Millington.
        He has two half-brothers, Jonathan (born September 12, 1993) and Stephen (born August 14, 1998), from Charles'
        second marriage to Lisa Perry.
        His half-sister Laura Katherine died shortly after birth on May 12, 1997, and is mentioned in his
        acknowledgments in the album NSYNC as "My Angel in Heaven".
        His family circle includes a number of musicians; his grandfather introduced him to music from country artists
        like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson.
