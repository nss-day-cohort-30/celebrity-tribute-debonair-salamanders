    <h3>Family and Early Life</h3>
    <p>
        Justin Randall Timberlake was born on January 31, 1981 in Memphis, Tennessee, 
        to Lynn (Bomar) Harless and Charles Randall Timberlake, a Baptist church choir director.
        Timberlake grew up in Shelby Forest, a small community between Memphis and Millington.
        He has two half-brothers, Jonathan (born September 12, 1993) and Stephen (born August 14, 1998), from Charles' second marriage to Lisa Perry. 
        His half-sister Laura Katherine died shortly after birth on May 12, 1997, and is mentioned in his acknowledgments in the album NSYNC as "My Angel in Heaven".
        His family circle includes a number of musicians; his grandfather introduced him to music from country artists like Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson.

    <h3>Relationships</h3>
    <p>
        In early 1999, Timberlake began dating fellow former The All-New Mickey Mouse Club cast member and singer
        Britney Spears.
        Their relationship ended abruptly in March 2002. In April 2003, he began dating actress Cameron Diaz soon after
        they met at the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards.
        After much speculation of breakups throughout their relationship, the couple split in December 2006 shortly
        after she introduced him as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live.
        In January 2007, Timberlake began dating actress Jessica Biel. They became engaged in December 2011 and married
        on October 19, 2012, at the Borgo Egnazia resort in Fasano, Italy.
        Timberlake and Biel have one son, Silas, born in April 2015.
